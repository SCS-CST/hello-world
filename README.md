# hello-world
Your hello-world repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

I am new to GitHub and still feel a little nervous about it. So far I learned that a branch of a repository copies it exactly as it is in the moment. Later we will be able to merge edits in the branch and bring them back into the main.
